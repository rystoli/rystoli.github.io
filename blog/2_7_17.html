<h2>Sorting out these trying times (study of modern conservatism)</h2>

<p>Per, likely, usual, this is not so much a blog post as a collection of information I would like to keep organized and share. As a liberal, I personally find many of the liberal reductionisms of sharp trends in the right wing unconvincing, i.e., 'Trumpism'. E.g., their motifs can be reduced to ignorance, greed, tribalism. And even where those motifs are real, understanding their source as intentional and nefarious seems unconvincing as well. I want to get the whole picture, the rational, the misguided, the history of it all... so I have recently set out to consume less hyper-partisan information explaining the current psychology of the right, and will collect it here. I will put concise notes by everything to give a bird's eye view.</p><p>This will be ongoing, and continue to be updated as I make progress. Tips appreciated.</p><p><strong>Books</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>1/4/17: 'Angry White Men' by Michael Kimmel</strong>: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/24/books/review/angry-white-men-by-michael-kimmel.html">NYT review</a>. Concerns causes, description, and appraisal of the current psychology of white men, especially on the right, in modern society. It does this tying together many modern phenomena, from anti-feminism to school shootings, under a general concept of 'aggrieved entitlement', where white men do not understand their privilege and feel grief and anger at its slow diminishment. Michael Kimmel is a sociologist. Uses a lot of data, with a lot of citations, which I appreciate and enjoy. It had an impressive amount of empathy and compassion towards 'angry white male' psychology, acknowledging when it is treated unfairly at times, and acknowledging some of its precursors, despite that overall the book errs on the side of hyper-liberalism on its opinionated side. Fun, easy read.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>2/9/17: 'The Unwinding: An inner history of the new America' by George Packer</strong>: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/29/books/the-unwinding-by-george-packer.html">NYT review</a>. Incredible, worthy of its awards and reviews. Very unique book in form (see NYT review). Tells the story of how we have gotten to modern 2017 America, from many corners of our story, being the lives of rural Americans to politicians to Silicon Valley to the media, in the form of several spread out narrative biographical stories, with the likes of Andrew Breitbart, Newt Gingrich, Oprah, Peter Thiel, and more. Non-partisan, beautiful non-fiction. Paints a nuanced,&nbsp;picture of a perfect storm that brought us here without invoking any blame.</li></ul><p><strong>Media</strong>:</p><p>This is a bit different. These are media outlets I follow to keep my finger on the other sides pulse. I will note below if I also think any of these sources provide compelling arguments that should be taken seriously at times, which is a different beat than the pulse we usually track as liberals.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><a href="http://www.breitbart.com/"><strong>Breitbart News</strong></a>: Duh. Really read the articles. Remember, some are opinion pieces, some are reporting. Set your expectations. You will be surprised by the amount of factual reporting, that through framing or omission rather than mendacity misleads.</li><li><a href="http://www.dailywire.com/"><strong>The Daily Wire</strong></a>: I have found this, and its founder <a href="https://twitter.com/benshapiro">Ben Shapiro</a> to be a good source for the more rational conservative pulse at the moment, and an amazing source for calling out lies and failures due to liberal bias on our end - which certainly exist. Though blind eyes and double standards often get in the way, they have been critical of many conservative biases as well.</li></ul><p><strong>Childhood friends from the south</strong>:</p><p>Just kidding. But, seriously. You should(n't) see my facebook feed.</p>
