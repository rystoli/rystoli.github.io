<h2>World travel as a graduate student</h2>

<hr>
In my time as a doctoral student living in New York City, I have been lucky enough to travel much of the world (21 countries so far!). Frequently, fellow grad students express shock and frustration that they could never afford travel internationally, even once a year. For many, of course not all, this is not true though. In the world today, there are tons of great resources with which you can travel affordably as a graduate student, sometimes breaking even, or, in fact, net gaining money (yes, I have often spent less money on and during time away than I would at home - I save money often by traveling abroad, though, more related to living in New York City of course).
<br><br>

Here I provide a concise set of instructions and tips, and a list of resources with which you can start your no/low/negative cost adventures.

<hr>
<br>

<h4>General strategy:</h4>
First, there are a few things to remember in advance:
<ul>
	<li>Your PI has to be cool with it? Though I'd think you could find some time over breaks. Stop being shy, and ask!</li>
	<li>You can work and travel! I spend weeks on the road a year that are not considered vacation by my PI, where I work a normal schedule. And it's amazing. I spent a week on the beach in Morocco working out of a rooftop cafe. I submitted a R&R from a rainforest hill (where I could get service) in Thailand. It's a discipline you'll learn, but if you can convince your PI this is reliable, well, you can live on the road (I mean, depending where, and for like a week or two).</li>	
	<li>Date flexibility can be the difference between how picky you are about location, and hundreds of dollars in flight costs.</li>
	<li>Conversely, location flexibility can be the difference between incredible costs on flight and local costs (accommodation/dining/activities). There are also places that estimate prices for backpackers, <a href="http://myfunkytravel.com/budgettraveltable.html">such as here</a>.</li>
	<li>This all only applies if you are willing to budget travel. I have had friends hit the road then decide they want to fly between all cities, stay in private bedrooms. These are possibilities in certain locations, but, one cost of seeing the world on a grad student budget is to travel within your means. It's also the best way to do it!</li>
</ul>

<h4>Spending</h4>
	
Then, let's get to the spending, which is the whole point. I do these every time, and I break even or save money every time. Generally, the process looks something like this: 
<ol>
	<li><b>Get your flight</b>. This can be done free (yes.) or cheap. Also, I said free (<--). This is the hardest part, and part most unfamiliar to people. I have a detailed guide below.</li>
	<li><b>Rent out your place god dammit</b>. Don't give me excuses, I've spent my life traveling and know countless people who use service like Airbnb, and have never had a problem (and you're fully insured by them). This saves as much money as your rent over that period. These days this is easy, use <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/">Airbnb</a>. They have mass insurance, you can vet your renters, requiring photo ID and looking at reviews etc. For longer terms, I use the many Facebook groups dedicated to finding apartments, and mass post my Airbnb, which I still make people book with so as to provide me and them insurance. Just use the search bar in Facebook to find these groups, or, Facebook Marketplace.</li>
	<li><b>Follow the many well-documented tips for budget traveling and backpacking</b>. Hostels, local transport, avoid tours, etc. Google this, it's the hobby and life of thousands of people, and many guides exist. You will also learn as you go. Check out websites like <a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/">Lonely Planet</a> of course, trite, sure, but shush it's useful.</li>
</ol>
To give an example, I recently spent 3 weeks in Mexico, backpacking across from Mexico City to Chiapas through the Yucatan. My roundtrip flight cost about $250 (via Kayak explore option), and daily costs were about $25 (hostels about $10, $15 can wine and dine you - these numbers are true in most developing countries). That's a total cost of around $750 for 3 weeks. I rented out my apartment (airbnb), and to boot, saved all the money I would have spent on local expenses in NYC (food, drink, etc), all of which easily break $750 for 3 weeks in NYC. So, my decision to travel not only cost nothing, but saved me a lot of money over this period. This of course changes by location, but minus flight differences is similar budgeting across developing countries especially.

<h4>Flights:</h4>

As I said, this seems to be the main factor that trips people up, involves the most niche knowledge. Here's a whole bunch on it:
<ol>
	<li><b>Free flight opportunities</b>: FREE. There are a number of ways to do this, here are some:
		<ul>
			<li><b>Student travel chaperone</b>: there are many companies that bring high school and college students around the world, especially during breaks, and need chaperones to ride on the airplanes with them to make sure they arrive safe. They often offer a free flight to anyone who will volunteer to fly there and back with the students. This means you meet the students at the departing airport, leave them with company staff at arrival, then travel on your own until they need to fly back! This has brought me to India and Morocco so far. Check out one example, <a href="https://rusticpathways.com/">Rustic Pathways</a>, who post their flight leader positions usually in December and January.</li>
			<li><b>Travel hacking</b>: Not my move, but, many people I meet on the road use various awards tricks to see the world for free. This is broken up into frequent flyer and credit card awards mostly. Google for tips! The term 'travel hacking' is often used.  <a href="http://zerototravel.com/trade-for-travel/beginners-guide-travel-hacking/">Here's onse site with tips</a>.</li>
			<li><b>Flight vouchers</b>: Take them. When the airline offers $500 to fly out 3 hours later, take it. That's one hell of a wage. Ask if they can award it to international travel, if not, use it to get to a location where you can get a budget flight out (see below). (Or fudge the funds towards a domestic flight you need, and use that money for the international flight!). When they start offering numbers, always go stand by the counter</li>
			<li><b>Reimbursed travel</b>: This is an option, just book an extra week or two before or after. Be resourceful, and seek out the many departmental and non-departmental funds and awards for things like conference travel. Make sure your travel plans will be reimbursed adding a week or two on, typically with someone in your admin. Many summer school options cover travel funds as well! Look through all summer school opportunities in your field.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><b>Budget flights</b>: cheap. This is easiest if you are flexible with location first, dates second. A flight to Australia is seldom cheap, yet from the US, affordable flights to Central and South America, Scandanavia, and various other countries are affordable. Though there are tricks for cheap flights.
		<ul>
			<li><b>Date/cost tables and calendars</b>: Various aggregation travel sites provide an option when choosing flight dates, you can specify a range of dates, and find the date with the best flight costs. I personally find <a href="https://www.kayak.com/">Kayak</a> has the best options, but also see similar sites, such as <a href="https://www.google.com/flights/">Google Flights</a> and <a href="https://www.skyscanner.com/">Skyscanner</a>.</li>
			<li><b>Location/price (and date) searches</b>: I am still a huge advocate for location flexibility, travel forever, and you'll eventually get to those top places you want to see. See those you can afford for now! <a href="https://www.kayak.com/">Kayak (explore option)</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/flights/">Google Flights</a> provide a fantastic service that show you a world map, you pick dates/seasons, your departing airport, and they show you flight prices across the world! For instance, I just checked winter flights in Kayak in just a minute, and found round-trip flights across China and southeast Asia for under $450!</li>
			<li><b>Layover ditching</b>: One of the great tricks to get places cheaper, or, to places you thought you could not afford at all, is getting a layover in a location you want to visit. For instance, I am traveling Australia, and found cheaper flights to Perth (west Australia) than Sydney, with a layover in Sydney. I'll just get off the plane and stay in Sydney. This requires a few important caveats of course: (1) don't check your bags (or they're going to the final stop), and (2) make sure the airline doesn't cancel returns on round-trips if you miss part of the departing flights (some airlines do this). <a href="https://skiplagged.com/">Skiplagged</a> and <a href="https://www.cleverlayover.com/
">Cleverlayover</a> are websites that searches for layovers! There are more.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ol>


Anyhow, that's it for now! I'm writing this from Montañita, Ecuador, and hope you all hit the road. Please share any resources you have with me, and I'll update.
