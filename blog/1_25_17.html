<h2> Data science shlacktivism compendium</h2>
<p>I have decided to aggregate opportunities for research and science types to volunteer their skill sets for the greater good, including general pro-social and political causes.</p><p>First, <a href="http://blog.datalook.io/definitive-guide-data-science-good/">here's a nice blog post with some details</a>&nbsp;from DataLook, a blog about data science social change.</p><p>Next, nothing too detailed, but concise is nice, so here is my tentative list...</p><p>Version 1/24/17:</p><ul style="margin-left:40px"><li><a href="http://www.datakind.org/">DataKind</a>: Has short and long-term opportunities that are quite variable. Primary chapters in certain locations (e.g., DC, SF), but of course much of this is remote, and there are certain projects/meetings in NYC. From some <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-DataKind-What-do-they-do-How-can-I-volunteering-if-I-dont-have-any-experience-and-what-would-it-benefit-me">Q&amp;A here</a>: "DataKind brings high-impact organizations together with data scientists to use data science in the service of humanity. We bring together top data scientists with leading social change organizations to collaborate on cutting-edge analytics and advanced algorithms to maximize social impact. Our programs build upon one another and are designed to meet organizations where they are. From evening or weekend events to multi-month projects, all are designed to provide social organizations with the pro bono data science innovation team they need to tackle critical humanitarian issues in the fields of education, poverty, health, human rights, the environment and cities. Go to the website to see the work DataKind has done so far."</li><li><a href="http://www.sumall.org/careers/">SumAll</a>: From their site: "We conduct analytics projects with organizations and changemakers who are pursuing common social change objectives. We are building our work on a methodology of transformational change through data, that continually searches for common-good and best practice. If you are looking to use your skills to solve big problems and work on specific missions together with amazing, like-minded people, we want to hear from you."</li><li><a href="https://www.codeforamerica.org/">Code for America</a>:&nbsp;Has larger positions, and local volunteer coding groups. From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_for_America">wiki</a>: "Code for America is a non-partisan, non-political 501(c)(3) organization founded in 2009 to address the widening gap between the public and private sectors in their effective use of technology and design. According to its website, the organization works with residents and governments in solving community problems.&nbsp;The organization began by enlisting technology and design professionals to work with city governments in the United States in order to build open-source applications and promote openness, participation, and efficiency in government, and has grown into a cross-sector network of practitioners of civic innovation and a platform for "civic hacking.""</li><li><a href="https://www.drivendata.org/about/">DrivenData</a>: Pro-social competition site, "At DrivenData, we want to bring cutting-edge practices in data science and crowdsourcing to some of the world's biggest social challenges and the organizations taking them on. We host online challenges, usually lasting 2-3 months, where a global community of data scientists competes to come up with the best statistical model for difficult predictive problems that make a difference."</li><li><a href="http://community.amstat.org/statisticswithoutborders/home">Statisticians Without Borders</a>: From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics_Without_Borders">wiki</a>: "Statistics Without Borders (SWB) is an organization of volunteer statisticians that provides pro bono statistical consulting and assistance to organizations or governments to help deal with health issues. SWB is sponsored by the American Statistical Association. Their goal is to help international health initiatives and projects be delivered more effectively through better use of statistics."</li><li><a href="http://www.bayesimpact.org/">Bayes Impact</a>: Y-combinator group, from site:&nbsp;We are a group of full-time data scientists, engineers, and academics who believe data science can be used to solve the world's most ambitious problems. We are a group of pragmatists who have seen first-hand how data science can solve industry problems at scale. We are a group of skeptics who realize that meaningful change requires dedication, focus and full-time work over long time periods, and that developing an algorithm is only the tip of the iceberg. We are a group of idealists who dedicate our lives to build operational solutions to social problems by building software for governments and non-profit organizations."</li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/opendatascience/">ODSFP</a> (Persontyle Open Data Science Fellows Program): From site: "Open Data Science Fellows Program (ODSFP) is for all of you who want to learn and apply data science. It is a collaborative platform to get together to learn data science, to solve meaningful open data problems, hang out, ask questions, share ideas and have a great time. This is a not-for-profit community program dedicated to the dissemination of data science and to promote open data for social good, organized by Persontyle School of Data Science." They have a twitter @ODSFP</li><li><a href="http://insight-us.org/">insightus</a>: From site: "insightus is leveling the playing field, by bringing outside-the-box Data Science to caring communities and progressive change activists, so that they can meet and beat special interests and ne'er-do-wells on their own turf in the 21st Century. We are a 100% non-profit organization: a band of brothers and sisters with crazy skills in Data Science, rolling up our sleeves to help out â€” to help make all our kids' world a better place tomorrow. We're taking a byte out of crime, and injustice, and incivility, and wanton greed."</li><li>Edgeflip: Looks like it's down, but was run by Rayid Ghani at Northwestern for pro-social change data science... will dig around more.</li><li><a href="http://scaan.net/">ScAAN</a>&nbsp;(Scientist Action and Advocacy Network): NYC based group. From site: "We are a New York-based group of scientists who partner with partisan and non-partisan organizations that are creating positive social change."</li></ul><p>Let me know any additional options and I'll update!</p>
