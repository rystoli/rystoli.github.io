<h2>Face stimulus and tool collection</h2>

<p>This is ongoing... <em>PLEASE</em> send any recommendations üòÅ</p><p>Without further ado, I present to you, the tardy solution to all of your suffering:</p><h1>The Face Stimulus and Tool Collection "blog" post</h1><br><p>Many of these have existed online in the past (I collected old collections as well, below), but many are filled now with dead links, and more importantly, horrible materials, e.g., real face stim that look faker than cg face stim.</p><p>Below, you'll find two main sections: face stim sets (all kinds), face stim tools (morph, averaging, real to cg scanning).&nbsp;</p><p>__________________________________________________________</p><h3>Face stimulus sets</h3><h4>Top quality /most prominent options:</h4><ul><li><a href="http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/bernd.wittenbrink/cfd/index.html">The Chicago Face Database</a>: Neutral, angry, fearful, happy, black, white, asian, latino, age 17-65</li><li><a href="http://faces.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/">The Max Planck FACES Database</a>: "171 younger (n = 58), middle-aged (n = 56), and older (n = 57) women and men displaying each of six facial expressions: neutrality, sadness, disgust, fear, anger, and happiness. It comprises two sets of pictures per person and per facial expression, resulting in a total of 2,052 images."</li><li><a href="http://www.socsci.ru.nl:8180/RaFD2/RaFD?p=main">Radboud Faces Database</a>: "67 models (including Caucasian males and females, Caucasian children, both boys and girls, and Moroccan Dutch males) displaying 8 emotional expressions...&nbsp;Accordingly to the Facial Action Coding System, each model was trained to show the following expressions: Anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise, contempt, and neutral. Each emotion was shown with three different gaze directions and all pictures were taken from five camera angles simultaneously."</li><li><a href="https://www.macbrain.org/resources.htm">NimStim</a>:&nbsp;fearful, happy, sad, angry, surprised, calm, neutral, disgusted, white, black, latino, asian</li><li><a href="http://www.emotionlab.se/resources/kdef">Karolinska Directed Emotional Faces</a>: "Participants: 70 (35 males and 35 females). Age: m 25 years, ranging from 20 to 30 years. Expressions: 7 (neutral, happy, angry, afraid, disgusted, sad, surprised). Angles: 5 (-90, -45, 0, +45, +90 degrees: i.e. full left profile, half left profile, straight, half)"</li><li><strong>Center for Vital Longevity Database:</strong>&nbsp;Existed once upon a time, but the <a href="http://agingmind.utdallas.edu/facedb">link is dead</a>. Ask your colleagues! These have been widely used, and are solid. I think they vary plenty in race, gender and age. Let me know if you find them online.</li><li><a href="http://wilmabainbridge.com/facememorability2.html">10k US Adult Faces Database</a>: Large, high quality collection of naturalistic face images with plenty of data to go along. "This database contains 10,168 natural face photographs and several measures for 2,222 of the faces, including memorability scores, computer vision and psychology attributes, and landmark point annotations. The face photographs are JPEGs with 72 pixels/in resolution and 256-pixel height. The attribute data are stored in either MATLAB or Excel files. Landmark annotations are stored in TXT files. Any parts of the database may be used upon citation of the article and acceptance of the license agreement. To obtain the database, fill out the following form to get access information. The psychology attributes now include participant information, so you can now easily study subject-centric (versus item-centric) face and memory effects. The database now additionally includes a software tool that allows you to export custom image sets from the database for your own research, based on our collected attributes and memorability information. (Ex: You can now easily create a stimulus set of faces based on memorability, gender, race, emotion, attractiveness, etc)." (Thanks for the tip, Jin Goh!)</li><li><a href="http://tlab.princeton.edu/databases/">Todorov Lab stim</a>: Amazing sets of CG (FaceGen) face stim, along many different personality trait judgments (e.g., trustworthiness, dominance... etc.)</li><li><a href="https://figshare.com/articles/Face_Research_Lab_London_Set/5047666">Face Research Lab London Set</a>: Images are of 102 adult faces 1350x1350 pixels in full colour. Template files mark out 189 coordinates delineating face shape, for use with Psychomorph or WebMorph.org. Self-reported age, gender and ethnicity are included in the file london_faces_info.csv. Attractiveness ratings (on a 1-7 scale from "much less attractiveness than average" to "much more attractive than average") for the neutral front faces from 2513 people (ages 17-90) are included in the file london_faces_ratings.csv. (Thanks DongWon Oh!)</li><li><a href="https://sirileknes.com/oslo-face-database/">Oslo face database</a>: "We have created a database of photographs of faces called the Oslo Face Database. It consists of ~200 male and female faces of neutral expression with three gaze directions: left, center and right. The photos were taken in 2012 and the faces are students from the University of Oslo. We have collected ratings of  attractiveness, trustworthiness and perceived dominance of faces. We have hand-drawn regions of interest (ROIs, see image) for a subset of these faces for use in eye-tracking analysis. For pupil measurements we also have available luminance-matched gray images that can be used for baseline pupillometry. (Thanks, Jennifer Yih!)</li><li><a href="http://agingmind.utdallas.edu/download-stimuli/face-database/">Minear and Park lifespan aging face database (center for vital longevity)</a>: "We describe a database of 575 individual faces ranging from ages 18 to 93. Our database was developed to be more representative of age groups across the lifespan, with a special emphasis on recruiting older adults. The resulting database has faces of 218 adults age 18-29, 76 adults age 30-49, 123 adults age 50-69, and 158 adults age 70 and older." (Was down for a bit, now back up, thanks for the tip, Eric Hehman!)</li><li><a href="http://ninastrohminger.com/the-mr2">The MR2 face database</a>: "The MR2 is a multi-racial, mega-resolution database of facial stimuli.  It contains 74 full-color images of men and women of European, African, and East Asian descent."</li>

<li><a href="http://mirellawalker.com/face-database">Basel face database</a>: "The aim of the Basel Face Database is to systematically deconfound faces and personalities. Therefore, we took standardized portrait photographs of 40 different individuals. We separately reduced and enhanced the facial information perceived as agentic and communal (Big Two), open to experience, conscientious, extraverted, agreeable, and neurotic (Big Five) in these faces. In two validation studies we show that all seven dimensions were successfully modeled in the 40 database faces." (unsure where to download, maybe contact them? Thanks for the lead, John Sciarappo!)</li>

Learn how to use them, it is very easy, no learning curve. Like excel macros, you can record what you do, then batch perform that on a folder of images. Therefore, removal or change of backgrounds with the wand tools, or vignetting around the face with a marquee and feather, can be recorded once, then performed on your 200 stimuli. Or grayscaling. Or changing the image sizes. Or cropping. It will save you(r RAs) so much time. You can also do fancy stuff such as touching up morphs and replacing features yourself with tools such as the stamp and blur tools.</li><li><a href="https://autohotkey.com/download/">Autohotkey</a>: Also for automation. Very small learning curve here to. You can automate anything on your computer that follows a pattern (anything, as in, opening up paint, drawing a smiley face, then emailing it to your colleagues). This program allows you to script anything into the computer inputs - cursor and keyboard. So, this comes very handy with FaceGen - where you can automate making face stimuli in case you need a batch of them (hint: use tab and shift+tab to move around easily). Eg, with random-lock on, automate generating a new face, then moving the sliders to make a more masculine version of the face, then save it, then make a more feminine, then save, then make older, save, younger, save. It's beautiful and saves 100 RA hours. They also have a program that records what you do like photoshop and excel macros to help you write up the script.&nbsp;</li><li><a href="http://www.irfanview.com/main_download_engl.htm">Irfanview</a> (windows) / Preview (mac) : Has easy batch image conversions on windows</li></ul><p>__________________________________________________________</p><p>More recommendations appreciated!</p>
