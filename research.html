<h3>Research</h3>


In our research, we hope to further outline the intricacies of how we form perceptions of others, with focus on categorizations (e.g., race) and trait impressions (e.g., competence) from faces. We see social perception as an integrative process, where top-down factors (e.g., stereotypes) may structure the way we perceive and represent others' social category memberships (e.g., race) and personality traits (e.g., trustworthiness). Importantly, our work bridges behavioral, neuroimaging, and computational methods to develop comprehensive ideas about both the structure and dynamics of these processes.

<br><br><h4>Social categorizations</h4>

How do we come to categorize others' race, gender, or age? In recent work, we found social categories that share stereotypes are perceived more similarly. For instance, male and black faces share 'dominance' trait stereotypes, and thereby facilitate perception of one another and share neural representations (Stolier & Freeman, 2016 - <i>Nature Neuroscience</i>; Brooks, Stolier, & Freeman, in press - <i>Social Cognition</i>). This work highlights an important, counter-intuitive route through which trait stereotypes can be activated during perception. In this case, categories perceived from a face (e.g., male) elicit activation of other categories not perceived (e.g., black), which in turn activate stereotypes and evaluations relevant to that other category (for instance, <a href="https://www8.gsb.columbia.edu/newsroom/newsn/2214/gender-and-race-how-overlapping-stereotypes-affect-interracial-dating-leadership-selection-and-athletic-participation">see work on behavioral consequences of this process by Galinsky, Hall, & Cuddy, 2013 — <i>Psychological Science</i></a>).

<br><br><h4>Trait impressions</h4>

In ongoing research, we find trait impressions based on others' facial appearance are structured by social knowledge. For instance, our internal beliefs about how personality traits covary in the world (are trustworthy people typically assertive?) may underlie how quick inferences from a face (how nice someone appears) may cascade into myriad personality impression (e.g., trustworthiness, extroversion, assertiveness, intelligence, creativity; <a href="./blog/9_8_17.html">work in progress, see demonstration here</a>). This has important implications for how we understand other people, especially as we may make consequential personality impressions (e.g., trustworthiness) about others based on what little we know about them (e.g., sociability). Furthermore, these trait associations (e.g., how trustworthy an intelligent person is perceived) may shift in certain contexts (e.g., trustworthiness and intelligence judgements become more negatively related towards females, as negative attitudes towards competent females prominent in the United States; Glick & Fiske, 1996 — <i>JPSP</i>).

<br><br><h4>Integrative neural networks</h4>

Across these many questions, my work combines behavioral, neuroimaging, and computational methods to build a coherent picture of these processes (Stolier & Freeman, 2016 - <i>Psychological Inquiry</i>). Our work has begun to elucidate how 'initial' social perceptions in visual brain regions are actually influenced by many higher-order processes, from stereotypes (via the orbitofrontal cortex; Stolier & Freeman, 2016 - <i>Nature Neuroscience</i>) to cognitive control (via the dorsal anterior cingulate; Stolier & Freeman, 2017 - <i>Journal of Neuroscience</i>). Future work hopes to extend computational accounts of social categorization (Freeman & Ambady, 2011 — <i>Psychological Review</i>) to develop a fuller picture of trait impression formations. These approaches play a crucial role in our work, both constraining and informing our theoretical perspectives.
